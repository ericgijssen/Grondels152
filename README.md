298mÂ²... what it is and what it could be(come)

BeCode wanted to open a school in Kuregem/Anderlecht and sought a partnership with Maks vzw. We found a place in the former spinning mill 'Le Vesdre', which now is owned by CityDev and in which the company Entrakt develops 'The Studio' in the coming 2 or 3 years.
As neighbours, BeCode will have a skatepark, a FabLab, filmstudio's, artists in residence, startups...
